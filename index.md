## About Me

Hi. I’m an assistant professor of economics and management science at Chapman University Argyros School of Business in Orange County, CA. Previously I lectured at MIT and Wellesley College.

My research interests include the economics of information systems, online media piracy and digitization strategy, decision support systems for data-driven decision making, IT strategy, and the impact of IT on society and firms. I use both predictive methods (applied machine learning and artificial intelligence, in particularly computer vision models) and causal inference methods to answer these questions. My research has appeared in leading journals (MIS Quarterly, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences) and computer science conferences (Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems).

I received my PhD in economics at Boston University. I’ve worked with firms and international organizations such as World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the International Monetary Fund on how to use machine learning to improve management processes. I still on occasion lecture on these topics for specific training. If that's of interest to you, please [reach out](mailto:hersh@chapman.edu). 

At Chapman I teach courses in machine learning, statistics, and business analytics. I am interested in pedagogical methods for delivering the best possible training in these methods. I’m always happy to talk with Chapman University students and faculty, particularly those interested in development and/or data science.
